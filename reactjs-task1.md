14. You should use Git for version control.

## Submission:
1. Please create a public GitHub / BitBucket repository for your project.
2. Your repository must have a detailed README.md with instructions on how to set up & run your code locally.
3. We would like you to present your work no later than 3 days from the day you receive your task.

### The presentation would be done in these steps:
1. Run your code locally
2. Give us a UI and features walkthrough
3. Explain your code
4. Run tests, if any

Feel free to use any additional packages, libraries, or UI frameworks you find useful. Provide the source code of the React.js app and any necessary instructions to run it.
