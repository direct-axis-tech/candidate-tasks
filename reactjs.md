# React.js Coding Challenge

## Problem
Create a React.js web application that displays a list of products and allows users to filter and sort them based on various criteria.

## Requirements
1. Fetch a list of products from an API endpoint (you can use any mock API or create a simple JSON file).
2. Display the list of products in a grid or list view, showing the product name, price, and an image.
3. Implement a filter functionality that allows users to filter products based on categories (e.g., electronics, clothing, books) or any other relevant criteria.
4. Implement a sorting functionality that allows users to sort products by price (low to high or high to low) or any other relevant criteria.
5. Include pagination or infinite scrolling to handle large product lists.
6. Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for products by name or any other relevant search criteria.
7. Add a feature to mark products as favorites and allow users to view their favorite products separately.
8. Implement proper error handling and loading states for API requests and data retrieval.
9. Use React Router to create multiple routes/pages, such as a product detail page when a product is clicked.
10. Use any state management library of your choice (e.g., Redux, MobX) to manage the app's state and handle data fetching and sharing.
11. The code should be well-organized, commented, and readable.
12. You should use Git for version control.

## Submission:
1.Create a Github repository for your code and commit your changes to it.
2. Build the application and put all all built files in a separate dir named ‘BUILD’ in project root
3.Share the Github repository link

Feel free to use any additional packages, libraries, or UI frameworks you find useful. Provide the source code of the React.js app and any necessary instructions to run it.

Remember, you can modify or extend this challenge according to your specific requirements and the skills you want to evaluate.
