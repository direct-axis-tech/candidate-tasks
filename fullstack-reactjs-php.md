# React.js Coding Challenge with Laravel API

## Problem: React.js Coding Challenge with Laravel API

## Problem
Create a React.js web application that displays a list of products and allows users to filter and sort them based on various criteria. Instead of using a mock API, we will use a Laravel API to fetch the list of products.

## Requirements
1. Set up a Laravel API with endpoints to fetch a list of products. The API should respond with product data in JSON format.
2. Create a React.js web application that fetches the list of products from the Laravel API.
3. Display the list of products in a grid or list view, showing the product name, price, and an image.
4. Implement a filter functionality that allows users to filter products based on categories (e.g., electronics, clothing, books) or any other relevant criteria. The filter options should be fetched from the API.
5. Implement a sorting functionality that allows users to sort products by price (low to high or high to low) or any other relevant criteria.
6. Include pagination or infinite scrolling to handle large product lists. The pagination details should be provided by the API.
7. Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for products by name or any other relevant search criteria.
8. Add a feature to mark products as favorites and allow users to view their favorite products separately. This data should be managed by the Laravel API and should be fetched accordingly.
9. Implement proper error handling and loading states for API requests and data retrieval.
10. Use React Router to create multiple routes/pages, such as a product detail page when a product is clicked.
11. Use any state management library of your choice (e.g., Redux, MobX) to manage the app's state and handle data fetching and sharing.
12. The code should be well-organized, commented, and readable.
13. You should use Git for version control.

## Submission:
1. Please create a public GitHub / BitBucket repository for your project.
2. Your repository must have a detailed README.md with instructions on how to set up & run your code locally. Include both instructions for setting up the Laravel API and the React.js app.
3. We would like you to present your work no later than 3 days from the day you receive your task.

### The presentation would be done in these steps:
1. Run your code locally (both the Laravel API and the React.js app).
2. Give us a UI and features walkthrough.
3. Explain your code, including how you structured the React components, state management, and API interactions.
4. Run tests, if any, and explain how you ensured code quality and correctness.

Feel free to use any additional packages, libraries, or UI frameworks you find useful. Provide the source code of both the Laravel API and the React.js app, along with any necessary instructions to run them.

Remember, you can modify or extend this challenge according to your specific requirements and the skills you want to evaluate.
